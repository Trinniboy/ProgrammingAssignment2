## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

# Below are two functions that are used to create a special object 
# that stores a numeric matrix and caches its mean
  
## Write a short comment describing this function

# The first function is a list containing a function to 
# 1. set the value of the matrix
# 2. get the value of the matrix
# 3. set the value of the inversed matrix
# 4. get the value of the inversed matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
    m <- NULL
  
    setMatrix <- function(y){
        x <-- y
        m <-- NULL
    }
    getMatrix <- function() x
    setInvMatrix <- function(InvMatrix) m <<- InvMatrix
    getInvMatrix <- function(InvMatrix) m 
      
    list(setMatrix = setMatrix, getMatrix = getMatrix,
           setInvMatrix = setInvMatrix,
           getInvMatrix = getInvMatrix)
  
}

## Write a short comment describing this function

# The second function calculates the inversed matrix of the special
# "matrix" created with the above function. However, it first checks
# to see if the inversed matrix has already been calculated. If so,
# it gets it from the cache and skips computation. Otherwise, it
# calculates the inversed matrix of the data and sets the value of 
# the inversed matrix in the cache via the setInvMatrix function.
  

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getInvMatrix()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
       message("getting the cached inversed matrix")
       return(m)
    }

    m <- solve(x$getMatrix())
    x$setInvMatrix(m)
    m
